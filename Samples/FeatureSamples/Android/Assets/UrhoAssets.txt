Drop here these folders from "Submodules\Urho3D\bin":
- CoreData
- Data
(turn on "show hidden files" and do "include" for all subdirectories)

They will be added once Xamarin Studio supports adding directories by link:

  <ItemGroup>
    <AndroidAsset Include="..\..\..\Submodules\Urho3D\bin\Data\**\*.*">
      <Link>Assets\Data\%(RecursiveDir)%(FileName)%(Extension)</Link>
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </AndroidAsset>
  </ItemGroup>
