 Skeletal animation example.
=============

This sample demonstrates:
- Populating a 3D scene with skeletally animated AnimatedModel components;
- Moving the animated models and advancing their animation using a custom component
- Enabling a cascaded shadow map on a directional light, which allows high-quality shadows
over a large area (typically used in outdoor scenes for shadows cast by sunlight)
- Displaying renderer debug geometry
