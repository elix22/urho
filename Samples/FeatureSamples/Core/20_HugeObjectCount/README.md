 Huge object count example.
=============

This sample demonstrates:
- Creating a scene with 250 x 250 simple objects
- Competing with http://yosoygames.com.ar/wp/2013/07/ogre-2-0-is-up-to-3x-faster/ :)
- Allowing examination of performance hotspots in the rendering code
- Using the profiler to measure the time taken to animate the scene
- Optionally speeding up rendering by grouping objects with the StaticModelGroup component
