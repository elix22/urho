 Moving character example.
=============

This sample demonstrates:
- Controlling a humanoid character through physics
- Driving animations using the AnimationController component
- Manual control of a bone scene node
- Implementing 1st and 3rd person cameras, using raycasts to avoid the 3rd person camera clipping into scenery
- Defining attributes of a custom component so that it can be saved and loaded
- Using touch inputs/gyroscope for iOS/Android (implemented through an external file)
