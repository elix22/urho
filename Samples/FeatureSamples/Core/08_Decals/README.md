 Decals example.
=============

This sample demonstrates:
- Performing a raycast to the octree and adding a decal to the hit location
- Defining a Cursor UI element which stays inside the window and can be shown/hidden
- Marking suitable (large) objects as occluders for occlusion culling
- Displaying renderer debug geometry to see the effect of occlusion
